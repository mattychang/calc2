some ideas for math 121/122 (20240808)

1. have two social events, one at the beginning (around labor day weekend) and end (finals grading week) of the semester. could both be potlucks? goal: get to know the newbies and reconvene with the older folks.
2. coordinate a concrete grading system: each week, another si creates the rubric as to how to grade the quizzes and sends it to us. that way, we are all on the same page.
3. important math gala jobs should be assigned to sophomores/juniors, such that they can teach the next generation.
4. office hours should overlap as little as possible, if can.
5. group photos!
